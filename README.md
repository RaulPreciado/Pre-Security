# Intro-to-Cybersecurity

https://tryhackme.com/paths

## Objectives:

teach you the pre-requisite technical knowledge to get started in cyber security. To attack or defend any technology, you have to first learn how this technology works.

## My Experience:

In this learning course, I learned about offensive and defensive security. I learned about networking and I was introduced to several vulnerabilites that are everywhere, such as spoofing. Additionally, I was also introduced to Linux and Windows and was able to get hands-on experience with these OS.

## Practice:
### This section will go over some of my hands on experience for this course:


1. SPOOFING

Change IP address to connect to Hotel WIFI without paying!

2. FIREWALL CONFIGURATION

correctly configure the firewall to prevent the device from overloading.

3. SENDING PACKETS

 Try sending a TCP packet from computer1 to computer3.

4. DNS REQUESTS

build requests to make DNS queries and view the results.

5. HTTP REQUEST

Use emulator for making demo HTTP requests (ex GET, DELETE, PUT)

6. HTML INJECTION

View the website on this task and inject HTML so that a malicious link to http://hacker.com is shown.

7. LINUX FUNDAMENTALS

 Learn how to use the Linux operating system, a critical skill in cyber security.

-Look for the apache2 logs on the deployable Linux machine

-get the IP address of the user who visited the site?

-What file did they access?

8. WINDOWS FUNDAMENTALS

Access to Windows and it's security controls that help with identifying, exploiting and defending Windows.
